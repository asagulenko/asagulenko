## 👋 Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub  

I'm just starting my journey in **Data Science**,  
and I couldn't be more excited about where this path will take me! 🚀  
When I'm not learning about data and analytics, you'll find me out on the water
🛶 — I'm a passionate sailor who loves adventure and the great outdoors. 🌊🌤️

(MIT Emergent Talent Program!).  
- 🛠️ **Skills in Progress**: Python, Git, Visual Studio.  
- 🌍 **Goal**: To contribute to impactful projects and grow  
as a data scientist.  
- ⛵ **Hobby**: Sailing whenever I get the chance!  

### 📫 Let's connect
